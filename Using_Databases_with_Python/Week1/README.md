# Object Oriented Python

To start this class out we cover the basics of Object Oriented Python. We won't be writing our own objects, but since many of the things we use like BeautifulSoup, strings, dictionaries, database connections all use Object Oriented (OO) patterns we should at least understand some of its patterns and terminology.
