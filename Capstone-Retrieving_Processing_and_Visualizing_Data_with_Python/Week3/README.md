# Exploring Data Sources (Project)

The optional Capstone project is your opportunity to select, process, and visualize the data of your choice, and receive feedback from your peers. The project is not graded, and can be as simple or complex as you like. This week's assignment is to identify a data source and make a short discussion forum post describing the data source and outlining some possible analysis that could be done with it. You will not be required to use the data source presented here for your actual analysis.
