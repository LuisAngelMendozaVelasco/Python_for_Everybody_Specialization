# Chapter One - Why we Program?

These are the course-wide materials as well as the first part of Chapter One where we explore what it means to write programs. We finished Chapter One and had the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the course, you may want to come back and look at these materials. This section should not take you an entire week.
